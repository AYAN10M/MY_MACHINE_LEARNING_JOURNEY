To run the anaconda environment for linux only use the following command:
source ~/.bashrc

After that we can use command related to conda.

** Creating a new virtual environment

Creating a new virtual environment for each project is a good practice. It helps to keep the dependencies separate and avoid conflicts. To create a new virtual environment, use the following command:
    conda create -p venv *python=3.10
    
    * this is optional, if you want to create a virtual environment with a specific version of python,   you can specify it using python=3.7 else it will create a virtual environment with the default version of python.

Activating the virtual environment:
    conda activate "C:\Users\AYAN HALDAR\Documents\MY_MACHINE_LEARNING_JOURNEY\BASICS\venv"
