    "## Running the Anaconda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the Anaconda environment for Linux, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can use commands related to `conda`.\n",

    "## Creating a New Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new virtual environment for each project is a good practice. It helps to keep dependencies separate and avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new virtual environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -p venv python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **`venv`**: This is the name of the virtual environment. You can replace it with any name you prefer.\n",
    "- **Python Version**: Specifying a Python version is optional. If you donâ€™t specify a version (e.g., `python=3.7`), it will use the default Python version.\n",

    "## Activating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment, use the command:\n",

    "## Installing Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install required packages individually using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Using a `requirements.txt` File\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of installing packages one by one, you can create a `requirements.txt` file containing the required package names and their versions. Then, install all packages at once using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "numpy\n",
    "pandas\n",
    "matplotlib\n",
    "scikit-learn\n",

    "\n",
    "This ensures a structured and efficient way to manage your project dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Alternative Way to Create a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create a virtual environment by using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, **venv** is the name of the virtual environment. You can give any name to the virtual environment. This will create a virtual environment with the default version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the above environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```"
