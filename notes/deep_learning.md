What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a specific approach within machine learning used to create powerful models for tasks like natural language translation, image recognition, and even game playing.
Its defining feature is the use of "deep stacks of computations," which means the models are built with many layers. Think of it like a modern assembly line: data enters at one end, and each layer performs a specific transformation on it, with the output of one layer becoming the input for the next. This allows the model to progressively refine information.
